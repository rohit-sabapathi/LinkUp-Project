There is no Node mdolues in the link_frontend folder so install using the Below command.

>> cd link_frontend
>> npm install

There is an environment for django/linkup_backend folder, i hope every package is installed for further assurance use the below code.

>> .\env\Scripts\activate
>> pip install -r requirements.txt
>> cd linkup_backend
